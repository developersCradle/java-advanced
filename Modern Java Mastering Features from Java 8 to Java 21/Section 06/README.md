</div>


1. **Lambda** can be called, **function without a name**. 

2. **Lambda** has same characteristics as the **functions**.
    - Method parameters.
    - Method Body.
    - Return Type.
3. Lambdas are not **tied** to any **class**. Like example Class methods.
4. In fact in can be passed as a **variable**.

<div align="center">
    <img src="syntaxOfTheLambdaExpression.PNG"  alt="java advanced" width="500"/>
</div>

- **Three** different parts in **Lambda Expression**

<div align="center">
    <img src="usagesOfTheLambda.PNG"  alt="java advanced" width="500"/>
</div>


1. Lambdas are used to implement **Functional Interfaces**.
    - Other names are called also, **SAM**. (**S**ingle **A**bstract **M**ethod).
2. **Functional Interfaces** are annotated with the `@FunctionalInterface`.

# Lab : Implement Runnable using Lambda.

- The first version of the **Lambda** will be using the old approach, **Anonymous Class**.

<div align="center">
    <img src="letsCodeOurFirstLegacyLamda.PNG"  alt="java advanced" width="500"/>
</div>

- Link to the example, which we will be making. [Link](https://github.com/dilipsundarraj1/java-8/blob/master/java-8/src/com/learnJava/lambda/RunnableLambdaExample.javahttps://github.com/dilipsundarraj1/java-8/blob/master/java-8/src/com/learnJava/lambda/RunnableLambdaExample.java).

<div align="center">
    <img src="anynomousClassExample.jpg"  alt="java advanced" width="500"/>
</div>

- We are exploring the `interface Runnable`. The definition is below:
    - IntelliJ, has double `shift` to search for the type.

 */
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Runnable {
    /**
     * Runs this operation.
     */
    void run();
}
````

- The **recommendation** is to use the `@FunctionalInterface` in the interface that has **one** the method defined. 

- We can see that usage of the **Anonymous Class**.

````
 new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Inside Runnable 1");
            }
````

- We are assigning it to the variable `Runnable runnable` as following:

````
/**
         * prior Java 8
         */

        Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Inside Runnable 1");
            }
        };

````

- We will pass the **Runnable** to the **Thread**.
    - `new Thread(runnable).start();` and start this.

<div align="center">
    <img src="lambdaExpressionExample.jpg"  alt="java advanced" width="500"/>
</div>

-  We are assigning it to the variable using **Lambda expression**.

````
        Runnable runnableUsingLambda = () -> {
            System.out.println("Some Runnable using lambda expression!");
        };
````

- We are executing this with the **Lambda Expression**.
    - With the following `new Thread(runnableUsingLambda).start();`.

- You can see that there are **fewer lines** of code.

- We can also, give it straight to the **Thread** as with **Lambda expression**.
    - Example **not** using as variable `new Thread(()-> System.out.println("Inside Runnable 4")).start();`.

<div align="center">
    <img src="lambdaBestPractives.PNG"  alt="java advanced" width="600"/>
</div>

1. If there is only **one** line.
2. If there are multiple lines inside **lambda expression**. You can use `{}`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Notice the difference between the styles, when assigning to the **functional interface**!

/**
 * A comparison function, which imposes a <i>total ordering</i> on
 * some collection of objects.  Comparators can be passed to a sort
 * method (such as {@link Collections#sort(List,Comparator)
 * Collections.sort} or {@link Arrays#sort(Object[],Comparator)
 * Arrays.sort}) to allow precise control over the sort order.
 * Comparators can also be used to control the order of certain data
 * structures (such as {@linkplain SortedSet sorted sets} or
 * {@linkplain SortedMap sorted maps}), or to provide an ordering for
 * collections of objects that don't have a {@linkplain Comparable
 * natural ordering}.<p>
 *
 * The ordering imposed by a comparator {@code c} on a set of elements
 * {@code S} is said to be <i>consistent with equals</i> if and only if
 * {@code c.compare(e1, e2)==0} has the same boolean value as
 * {@code e1.equals(e2)} for every {@code e1} and {@code e2} in
 * {@code S}.<p>
 *
 * Caution should be exercised when using a comparator capable of imposing an
 * ordering inconsistent with equals to order a sorted set (or sorted map).
 * Suppose a sorted set (or sorted map) with an explicit comparator {@code c}
 * is used with elements (or keys) drawn from a set {@code S}.  If the
 * ordering imposed by {@code c} on {@code S} is inconsistent with equals,
 * the sorted set (or sorted map) will behave "strangely."  In particular the
 * sorted set (or sorted map) will violate the general contract for set (or
 * map), which is defined in terms of {@code equals}.<p>
 *
 * For example, suppose one adds two elements {@code a} and {@code b} such that
 * {@code (a.equals(b) && c.compare(a, b) != 0)}
 * to an empty {@code TreeSet} with comparator {@code c}.
 * The second {@code add} operation will return
 * true (and the size of the tree set will increase) because {@code a} and
 * {@code b} are not equivalent from the tree set's perspective, even though
 * this is contrary to the specification of the
 * {@link Set#add Set.add} method.<p>
 *
 * Note: It is generally a good idea for comparators to also implement
 * {@code java.io.Serializable}, as they may be used as ordering methods in
 * serializable data structures (like {@link TreeSet}, {@link TreeMap}).  In
 * order for the data structure to serialize successfully, the comparator (if
 * provided) must implement {@code Serializable}.<p>
 *
 * For the mathematically inclined, the <i>relation</i> that defines the
 * <i>imposed ordering</i> that a given comparator {@code c} imposes on a
 * given set of objects {@code S} is:<pre>
 *       {(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) &lt;= 0}.
 * </pre> The <i>quotient</i> for this total order is:<pre>
 *       {(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) == 0}.
 * </pre>
 *
 * It follows immediately from the contract for {@code compare} that the
 * quotient is an <i>equivalence relation</i> on {@code S}, and that the
 * imposed ordering is a <i>total order</i> on {@code S}.  When we say that
 * the ordering imposed by {@code c} on {@code S} is <i>consistent with
 * equals</i>, we mean that the quotient for the ordering is the equivalence
 * relation defined by the objects' {@link Object#equals(Object)
 * equals(Object)} method(s):<pre>
 *     {(x, y) such that x.equals(y)}. </pre>
 *
 * In other words, when the imposed ordering is consistent with
 * equals, the equivalence classes defined by the equivalence relation
 * of the {@code equals} method and the equivalence classes defined by
 * the quotient of the {@code compare} method are the same.

 * <p>Unlike {@code Comparable}, a comparator may optionally permit
 * comparison of null arguments, while maintaining the requirements for
 * an equivalence relation.
 *

 * <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html#CollectionsFramework">

- Purpose of this is to compare **two** of something.

- We are not **instantiating the interface** directly—you are creating an anonymous class that **implements the interface**.
    - As in this example `new Comparator<Integer>()`.
        - This **compare** will be using following logic:
            - `0` → if **both** are `equal`.
            - `1` → if `o1 > o2`.
            - `-1` → if `o1 < o2`.


<div align="center">
    <img src="lambdaexpressionComparatorExample.jpg"  alt="java advanced" width="500"/>
</div>

- We are using **Lambda Expression** for the Comparator.

````
Comparator<Integer> comparatorLambda = (Integer  a,Integer b) -> a.compareTo(b);
System.out.println(comparatorLambda.compare(1,2));
````

- And the another example.
    - The `Comparator<Integer> comparatorLambda1 = (a,b) -> a.compareTo(b);` and the `System.out.println(comparatorLambda1.compare(1,2));`.
